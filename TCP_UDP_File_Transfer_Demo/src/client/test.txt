Here is some test file I keep in SRC
This project I basically need to run the following in 3 terminals:
cd to cache, client, and server, one for each terminal:
in server terminal:
javac *.java
java Server 10000 tcp

in cache terminal:
java Cache 20000 localhost 10000 tcp

in client terminal:
java Client localhost 10000 localhost 20000 tcp

For SNW do the following:
in server terminal:
javac *.java
java Server 10000 snw

in cache terminal:
java Cache 20000 localhost 10000 snw

in client terminal:
java Client localhost 10000 localhost 20000 snw
