Here is some test file I keep in SRC
This project I basically need to run the following in 3 terminals:
cd to cache, client, and server, one for each terminal:
in server terminal:

javac *.java
java Server 21000 tcp

in cache terminal:
java Cache 22000 localhost 21000 tcp

in client terminal:
java Client 169.226.22.17 21000 169.226.22.17 22000 tcp






For SNW do the following:
in server terminal:
javac *.java
java Server 10000 snw

in cache terminal:
java Cache 20000 localhost 10000 snw

in client terminal:
169.226.22.17 //<----- replace localhost with this
java Client localhost 10000 localhost 20000 snw
